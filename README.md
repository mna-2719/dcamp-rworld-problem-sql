# Applying SQL to Real-World Problems

In this course, I worked with a database of a fictional movie rental company. The size and complexity of this database allowed me to experience the challenges of working with databases firsthand. Throughout this course, I utilized SQL to answer business-driven questions. I learned new skills that empowered me to find the tables I need. Also, I learned how to store and manage this data in tables and views that I created. Best of all I also learned how to write code that not only clearly conveys my intent but is also legible.
